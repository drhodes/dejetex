# Project Goals

Problem: Debugging latex can be a pain because there is no formal
grammar for which to build tools upon. 

Goal: To define a grammar and implement a parser with associated tools
for a substantial subset of $\LaTeX$. The grammar adds an unsafe
environment for unchecked latex, which the tools will simply ignore.


## Benefits: 

Users will enjoy futuristic ameneties such as:

    - syntax errors
    
Possible features:

    - syntax highlighting
    - goto definition


## NonGoals : 

Reimplementing the latex ecosystem
